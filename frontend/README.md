# Thrice

## How To Play

> 5 rounds of brain gymnastics, each from a different category
> 3 questions per round, all with the same answer (how convenient!)
> Go ahead and guess, a wrong answer is the same as passing.
> Scoring:
> 1st try = 3, 2nd = 2, 3rd = 1
> After that, well... better luck next question!
